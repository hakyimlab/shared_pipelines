Here, we have some pipelines and scripts that we all use in common

- `enformer_pipeline` : legacy-code, still works

- `enformer_pipeline_aggregate`: similar pipeline to `enformer_pipeline` but with added functionalities like being able to average the bins on-the-fly e.t.c. The eventual goal is to make this the main pipeline.
